# Visual-Question-Answering-In-Medical-Domain
VQA is a multidisciplinary problem which combines two modalities: text and image. It
requires computer vision and NLP techniques (probably, reasoning techniques too). The
task is to answer a question correctly, where the question is accompanied by an image
on which it is based.

This assignment is a domain specific challenge. ImageCLEF defines the challenge as
follows: “Given a medical image accompanied with a clinically relevant question,
participating systems are tasked with answering the question based on the visual image
content”.
